# ClockIO

An Android app to track and send active app info

## What I Got So Far:
* Lists available apps on device
* Can select multiple apps to monitor
* Detects input for select apps only
* Input window of 15 seconds
* Creates notification in bar
* Click notification to finish monitoring
* Displays elapsed time once app is exited

## What I Need to Do Still:
* More DB optimization
* Spruce it up
* Test on actual device

## What I Can Investigate More
* Screenshots?
* Send crashdump?
