# ClockIO

An Android app to track and send active app info

## What I Got So Far:
* Lists available apps on device
* Can select multiple apps to monitor
* Detects input for select apps only
* Creates notification in bar
* Click notification to finish monitoring
* Displays elapsed time once app is exited

## What I Need to Do Still:
* Send email with info
* Keep track of time more actively
* Spruce it up

## What I Can Investigate More
* Screenshots?
* Send crashdump?
