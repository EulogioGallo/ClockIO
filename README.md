# ClockIO

An Android app to track and send active app info

## What I Got So Far:
* Lists available apps on device
* Can select multiple apps to monitor
* Detects input for select apps only
* Input window of 15 seconds
* Creates notification in bar
* Click notification to finish monitoring
* Displays elapsed time once app is exited
* Detects when screenshot is taken
* Created settings menu for logging in, etc.

## What I Need to Do Still:
* More DB optimization
* Spruce it up
* Hook into API
* Make "ResultActivity" hidden

## What I Can Investigate More
* Send crashdump?

## Known Bugs
* Pushing back button instead of home while testing app adds remaining time to ClockIO instead of monitored app
