# ClockIO

An Android app to track and send active app info

## What I Got So Far:
* Lists available apps on device
* Launches app
* Creates notification in bar
* Click notification to close monitored app
* Displays elapsed time once app is exited

## What I Need to Do Still:
* Send email with info
* Keep track of time more actively
* Spruce it up
