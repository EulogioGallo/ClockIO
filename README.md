# ClockIO

An Android app to track and send active app info

## What I Got So Far:
* Lists available apps on device
* Can select multiple apps to monitor
* Detects input for select apps only
* Input window of 15 seconds
* Creates notification in bar
* Click notification to finish monitoring
* Displays elapsed time once app is exited
* Detects when screenshot is taken

## What I Need to Do Still:
* More DB optimization
* Spruce it up
* Show app list in alphabetical order
* Add login functionality
* Make "ResultActivity" hidden
* Restrict screenshot detection to when in-app only

## What I Can Investigate More
* Send crashdump?
